    get:
      tags:
        - Matches
      summary: Get complete details for a specific match
      description: |
        **What you get:** Everything about one match - scores, statistics, events (goals, cards), referee, stadium, attendance.
        
        **Why it's useful for betting:**
        - Deep dive into match statistics (possession, shots, xG)
        - See when goals were scored (early/late game patterns)
        - Check referee influence and attendance
        - Understand match flow through events timeline
        
        **Key statistics explained:**
        - **xG (Expected Goals)**: Measures shot quality. xG of 2.5 means the team created chances worth 2.5 goals
        - **Possession**: Ball control percentage. High possession doesn't always mean more goals!
        - **Shots on target**: Actual dangerous attempts that tested the goalkeeper
        
        **Example use:** Before betting on Flamengo's next match, check their last 3 matches to see xG trends

      summary: Team performance ranking based on Expected Goals (xG)
      description: |
        **What you get:** Teams ranked by their offensive and defensive quality using xG metrics.
        
        **What is xG?** 
        Expected Goals measures the quality of chances created. A shot from inside the box has higher xG than a shot from 30 meters.
        
        **How to use for betting:**
        - **avg_xg_for (Attack)**: How many quality chances the team creates per match
          - High = Strong attack, creates many dangerous chances
          - Low = Weak attack, struggles to create good opportunities
        
        - **avg_xg_against (Defense)**: How many quality chances the team concedes per match
          - High = Weak defense, allows many dangerous shots
          - Low = Strong defense, limits opponent chances
        
        **Betting insights:**
        - Team with high xG_for but low actual goals → Unlucky, might score more soon (value bet)
        - Team with low xG_for but high actual goals → Lucky, might regress to the mean
        - High xG_against → Vulnerable defense, good for "Both teams to score" bets
        
        **Example:** If Flamengo has avg_xg_for=2.5 but only scores 1.5 goals/match, they're likely to improve.

      summary: Overall championship statistics
      description: |
        **What you get:** High-level stats about the entire Brasileirão season.
        
        **Metrics included:**
        - **total_matches**: How many matches have been played
        - **total_goals**: Total goals scored in the championship
        - **avg_goals**: Average goals per match
        
        **Why it's useful for betting:**
        - **avg_goals** helps set expectations for Over/Under bets
          - If avg is 2.5 goals/match, a bet on Over 2.5 is risky
          - If avg is 3.2 goals/match, league has high scoring pattern
        
        - Compare individual match xG to league average to spot outliers
        - Understand if this season is high-scoring or defensive
        
        **Example use:** League avg is 2.8 goals → Both teams average 1.5 xG → Total 3.0 xG → Bet Over 2.5 goals
